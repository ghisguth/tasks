[section:eventvar_ref Event Variables]

[heading Synopsis]

__boost_fiber__ provides event variables to facilitate coordination between fibers.
A event-variable has two states `set` (`signaled`) or `reset` (`nonsignaled`).

[note event-variables are bound to the __scheduler__ passed to the constructor and can only be used by fibers
managed by this scheduler.]

    boost::fibers::scheduler<> sched;
    boost::fibers::auto_reset_event ev( sched);

    void process_data();

    void wait_for_data_to_process()
    {
        ev.wait();
        process_data();
    }

`wait` will atomically add the fiber to the set of fibers waiting on the event
variable. When the fiber is woken, the event variable will be reset again.

In the mean time, another fiber signals the event variable by calling
`set` on the event variable to wake one waiting fiber.

    void retrieve_data();
    void prepare_data();

    void prepare_data_for_processing()
    {
        retrieve_data();
        prepare_data();
        ev.set();
    }


[section:auto_reset_event Class `auto_reset_event`]

[heading Synopsis]

When the ['auto_reset_event] gets signaled, any one fiber will see this particular signal. When a fiber observes
the signal by waiting on the event, it is automatically transitioned back to non-signaled state. Any fibers can
subsequently set the event.

    #include <boost/fiber/auto_reset_event.hpp>

    class auto_reset_event : private boost::noncopyable
    {
    public:
		template< typename Strategy >
        explicit auto_reset_event( scheduler< Strategy > & sched, bool isset = false);

        ~auto_reset_event();

        void set();

        void wait();

        bool try_wait();
    };

[variablelist
[[Effects:] [Constructs an object of class `auto_reset_event`. If isset is `true`
the variable is set.]]
[[Throws:] [Nothing.]]

[variablelist
[[Effects:] [If any fibers are currently __blocked__ waiting on `*this` in a call
to `wait`, unblocks one of those fibers.]]
[[Throws:] [Nothing.]]

[endsect]

[section:wait `void wait()`]
[variablelist
[[Effects:] [Blocks the current fiber. The fiber will unblock when notified by a call
to `this->set()`. When the fiber is unblocked, the variable is reset before `wait`
returns.]]

[section:manual_reset_event Class `manual_reset_event`]

[heading Synopsis]

The ['manual_reset_event] remains signaled until it is manually reset. Multiple fibers
wait on the same event and observe the same signal.

    #include <boost/fiber/manual_reset_event.hpp>

    class manual_reset_event : private boost::noncopyable
    {
    public:
		template< typename Strategy >
        explicit manual_reset_event( scheduler< Strategy > & sched, bool isset = false);

        ~manual_reset_event();

        void set();

        void reset();

        void wait();

        bool try_wait();
    };

[section:set `void set()`]

[[Effects:] [If any fibers are currently __blocked__ waiting on `*this` in a call

gets called.]]
[[Throws:] [Nothing.]]

[section:count_down_event Class `count_down_event`]

[heading Synopsis]

The ['count_down_event] decrements an internal counter (set in the constructor) and all
waiting fibers are blocked until the count reaches zero.

    #include <boost/fiber/count_down_event.hpp>

    class count_down_event : private boost::noncopyable
    {
    public:
		template< typename Strategy >
        explicit count_down_event( scheduler< Strategy > & sched, unsigned int initial);

        ~count_down_event();

        unsigned int initial() const;

        unsigned int current() const;

        bool is_set() const;

        void set();

        void wait();
    };

[section:constructor `template< typename Strategy > explicit count_down_event( scheduler< Strategy > & sched, unsigned int initial)`]

[[Effects:] [Constructs an object of class `count_down_event` with initial value.]]
[[Throws:] [Nothing.]]

[section:wait `void wait()`]
